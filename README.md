# OPAL
## Orbital Peace Assurance Laser
RimWorld mod

OPAL is a satellite that orbits your rimworld and every now and then it will come in range of your comms console. Buy a use of OPAL's laser and you will be given a laser guidance device. In a time of great need, deploy the laser and watch your foes be vapourised! You only get one use per purchase though so use it wisely.

Thanks to the Industrialization mod, originally developed my eatKenny and currently maintained by duduluu, for their skydriller code, without which this mod would not have been possible.

This mod was designed with modded storytellers in mind, such as Pandora Dark by Britnoth. For vanilla gameplay, it might be a bit overpowered, although it is very expensive to compensate.
